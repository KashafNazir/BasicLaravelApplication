<h1>Welcome To Laravel</h1>
       <p>This is my first Laravel Project learning from Youtube series "Laravel from scratch"</p>
       <p>I am very happy to learn this flexible platform which makes the things happen in an easier way.</p>
       <p>This project has taught me lots of interesting things about Laravel Projects and their developments.</p>
       <p>Laravel is a free, open-source PHP web framework, created by Taylor Otwell and intended for the development of  </p>
       <p>web applications following the model–view–controller architectural pattern and based on Symfony.</p>
